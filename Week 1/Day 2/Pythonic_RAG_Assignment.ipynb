            "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on what you are trying to achieve. However, there are some general guidelines to follow for clarity and efficiency. Here are a couple of common types of loops and best practices:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Using a `for` Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "If you know the number of iterations in advance or you’re iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), a `for` loop is typically the most straightforward option:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Iterating over a list of numbers\n",
            "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "for number in numbers:\n",
            "    print(number)  # This will print each number in the list\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Using a `while` Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "If the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition, consider using a `while` loop:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Counting up until a condition is met\n",

            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",
            "    count += 1  # Make sure to modify the condition to eventually stop the loop\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Best Practices\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Readability**: Write loops that are easy to read. Use meaningful variable names and add comments if necessary.\n",
            "- **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Make sure your loop has a clear exit condition to prevent it from running indefinitely.\n",
            "- **Use List Comprehensions**: If you’re generating a list, consider using a list comprehension for a more concise and efficient approach:\n",
            "  \n",
            "  ```python\n",
            "  squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]  # Generates a list of squares from 0 to 9\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "  \n",
            "- **Keep It Simple**: If your loop’s body is becoming too complex, consider breaking it out into a separate function.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example of a Well-structured Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's an example that combines some of these practices:\n",
